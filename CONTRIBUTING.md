## How to Contribute

## Commit Message Guidelines

This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) to ensure consistent and meaningful commit messages. Commit messages should follow this format:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Types
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Examples
- `feat: add support for custom addon paths`
- `fix: resolve issue with changelog formatting`
- `docs: update installation instructions`

## Changelog

The changelog is automatically maintained using [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format and generated by release-please. Contributors do not need to manually update `CHANGELOG.md`; conventional commits will be parsed and added automatically during the release process.

## Coding Standards

- **Python Version**: >= 3.9
- **Formatting**: Use Black with line length 120
- **Linting**: Follow flake8 rules
- **Testing**: Write pytest tests with good coverage
- **Type Checking**: Use Pyright for static analysis

Run `make format` and `make lint` before committing.

## Pull Request Process

- Ensure all CI checks pass
- Provide a clear description of the changes
- Reference any related issues
- Request review from maintainers

## Releases

Releases are automated using release-please. Conventional commits determine version bumps:
- `feat` commits trigger minor version bumps
- `fix` commits trigger patch version bumps
- `BREAKING CHANGE` in footer triggers major version bumps

Release PRs are created automatically; merge them to trigger releases.
